# Minor-Project-2
Assistant Robot autonomously guides users in a laboratory using real-time human tracking with YOLOv8 and smooth navigation via Kalman filtering. An ESP32 controls motors for safe, precise movement. A Flask-based QA system with FAISS and an LLM answers lab queries and provides audio responses, showcasing integrated AI, IoT, and robotics.
